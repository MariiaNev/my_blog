                    <p class="first-block__text helvetica-medium">This week was dedicated to taking my UX research
                        further — focusing on the complex, often overwhelming journey of buying a home in New Zealand.
                        My goal was to better understand the needs, frustrations, and mental models of users navigating
                        housing affordability.</p>

                <h2>Interview Planning</h2>
                <p>I drafted a set of interview questions and decided to split participants into two distinct groups:
                    those who have already purchased property in NZ and those who are currently looking. This helped me
                    approach the issue from both reflective and aspirational points of view.
                </p>
                <h2>Expanding the Secondary Research</h2>
                <p>I added more depth to my research by gathering additional data, reports, and user stories. These
                    insights helped shape a clearer picture of the broader challenges.</p>
                <h2>Competitor & Market Analysis</h2>
                <p>I looked into existing tools and platforms related to property search and financing. The goal was to
                    spot gaps and opportunities where thoughtful design could genuinely improve the experience.</p>
                <h2>Government Support</h2>
                <p>To understand the institutional landscape, I reviewed current support schemes for first-time buyers.
                    This helped me identify both informational gaps and usability challenges in the way these programs
                    are presented to the public.</p>

                <h2>Preparing for WIP 01</h2>
                <p>This week also included my first Work-In-Progress (WIP 01) presentation. It went well overall, but it
                    became clear that my research still needed refinement — especially in terms of how insights were
                    visually communicated.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Over the weekend, I focused on:</p>
                <p>Empathy Mapping and Persona Development</p>
                <p>Creating a detailed Current State User Journey</p>
                <br />
                <p>The journey mapping process took more time than I expected — the number of touchpoints, decisions,
                    and emotional spikes throughout the housing process is huge. But unpacking that complexity was
                    valuable. These tools are now guiding my thinking as I move into design ideation, helping me
                    identify where targeted design interventions could make a real difference.</p>
