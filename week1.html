                        Monday, we were introduced to our major assignment — New Enterprise. The goal is to identify a
                        meaningful social issue and, through design, propose an innovative solution that creates real
                        value
                        for communities.</p>

                <h2>Finding My Focus</h2>
                <p>At the start of the week, I began thinking about what topics genuinely resonate with me — and where I
                    could make a difference as a designer. Initially, I considered exploring mental health, particularly
                    around stigma and emotional burnout. I began gathering research and data to help narrow down and
                    define a more specific direction.
                </p>
                <p>However, after speaking with my mentor and tutor Melody on Wednesday, we came to the conclusion that
                    while mental health is an important area, it's often been explored by other designers. She
                    encouraged me to consider a direction that would still be impactful — but less commonly approached —
                    to give me the opportunity to bring a fresh perspective and stand out.</p>
                <p>That conversation led me to the topic of housing affordability — a highly relevant and urgent issue
                    for young people in Aotearoa New Zealand. It's particularly significant in Auckland, where,
                    according to the Issues Monitor, February 2025, housing remains one of the top concerns for my
                    generation (see screenshot below).</p>

                    <div class="content__link">
                        <a href="https://www.housingfirst.co.nz/" title="https://www.housingfirst.co.nz/"

                </div>
                <h2>Diving into the Problem</h2>
                <p>Once I settled on housing affordability, I began collecting data and insights to better understand
                    the depth of the issue and where design could make a meaningful contribution. I focused on questions
                    like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why is it so difficult for young or single-income individuals to purchase a home?</li>
                    <li>What barriers exist — financial, legal, informational?</li>
                    <li>How aware are people of available support options, and how accessible are they?</li>
                    <li>Could co-living or shared ownership be viable alternatives?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Through reading government reports, analyzing statistics, and reviewing personal stories, I began
                    identifying key sub-problems and sketching out some initial project ideas. This helped clarify the
                    direction I want to take and allowed me to start thinking about who my target audience might be and
                    what kind of support they really need.</p>
                <p>This exploration was the core focus of my first sprint, and I feel like I've achieved that goal. The
                    next challenge will be planning and conducting user interviews to hear directly from those affected
                    by this issue. Finding the right people to speak with will take effort, but it's an important step
                    forward.</p>
                <p>This topic also feels deeply personal — my partner and I are currently thinking about buying our
                    first home, and I know firsthand how confusing and overwhelming the process can be. A wrong decision
                    can cost a lot, both financially and emotionally. Through this project, I want to help others
                    navigate this journey with more clarity and confidence.</p>
